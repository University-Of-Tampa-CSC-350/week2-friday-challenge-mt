## Github Classrooms
We will be using Github classroom to do in-class Friday Challenges.
You can make as many commits and as many pushes as needed to the main branch on your forked copy of the repo.
The notes about commits are still relevant here:
To be consistent, use the same styling for commit messages that was given in the Project I:
- PREFIX – Short description of the change
  A detailed description can be added to the commit in the long description, if needed.
  The following are the possible options for [Prefix]
- [FEAT] - For new features or major additions to the project.
  FEAT - Added button click-ability feature 
- [FIX] - For bug fixes, corrections, or revisions to the code.
  FIX - Corrected navigation bar alignment on mobile devices
- [STYLE] - For stylistic changes such as formatting, CSS modifications, or minor visual updates.
  STYLE - Updated color scheme for better contrast
- [DOCS] - For changes or additions to the documentation, including README files and comments in the code.
  DOCS - Added project description and setup instructions to README
- [SECURITY] - For changes related to improving the security of the website.
  SECURITY - Implemented input validation for contact form
- [REFACTOR] - For code refactoring that doesn’t change functionality but improves code quality or organization.
  REFACTOR - Organized attributes for button components files in Home layout.
- [TEST] - For adding tests or making changes to the testing suite.
  TEST - Added validation tests for login form input

### 5. Submitting your work
Once, you are sure that all the work is completed, go through the following steps for submission.
Push all your work onto the main branch. **Only the main branch** will be considered for grading.

## Project description
### Task 1: UI Tetris (A login screen)
You are given a set of UI components in task1_layout, your goal is organize them such that layout feels intentional and useful
for the end-user.
You:

1. must group related elements using layouts or containers or nest them under various appropriate containers
2. cannot add more UI elements
3. can change attributes of all the widgets that are present on the screen
4. cannot change the parent layout and it should stay as Constraint Layout 
5. Can add more nested layouts to help you organize the screen 
6. establish a clear visual hierarchy 
7. improve spacing and alignment

### Task 2: The Worst Layout Wins
Work on task2_layout file, the components are the same as task1, but this time Your goal is to make it as bad as possible - while still technically working.
You are not allowed to leave this task without making changes.
Turn this screen into the worst login screen imaginable using only layout changes.

Hints on how to design this screen:
1. confusing 
2. frustrating 
3. uncomfortable 
4. unintuitive
If a user opened this screen, they should immediately feel lost.

You must:
1. keep all existing UI components 
2. make visible layout changes 
3. ensure the screen still renders

You may:

1. rearrange elements 
2. change the parent layout here 
3. misuse spacing and alignment 
4. apply layouts in poor ways 
5. make bad hierarchy decisions on purpose 
6. add new elements
7. add styling to widgets

You may not:

1. delete elements already present 
2. add logic or validation 

The app is set to display the MainActivity, you can change it to a different one, although its not required.

**Make sure to test that your app runs after making all the above changes**
